# MeerFish

A Fisher forecast code focusing on upcoming large-sky single-dish HI intensity mapping cosmological surveys with MeerKAT and its successor the SKAO.

>  - "Meer" is Afrikaans for "more", KAT is the Karoo Array Telescope<br/>
> To survey the Universe at radio wavelengths we have **MeerKAT**<br/>
> For providing updated Fisher forecasts we have **MeerFish**

Please refer to the notes in MeerFish_notes.pdf for some detailed formalism covering these codes.
