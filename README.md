# MeerFish

A Fisher forecast code focusing on upcoming large-sky single-dish HI intensity mapping cosmological surveys with MeerKAT and its successor the SKAO.

>  - "Meer" is Afrikaans for "more", KAT is the Karoo Array Telescope<br/>
> To survey the Universe at radio wavelengths we have **MeerKAT**<br/>
> For providing updated Fisher forecasts we have **MeerFish**

## Getting started:

Git clone this repo:
``git clone https://github.com/meerklass/MeerFish.git``

We then recommend going through the notebook in
``demo/getting_started.ipynb``


Please refer to the notes in Appendix A of https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27549 for some detailed formalism covering these codes.
